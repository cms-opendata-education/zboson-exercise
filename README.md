# Particle physics data-analysis with CMS open data
This repository contains material for the exercise where real data from CMS experiment at CERN is used
for a simple particle physics data-analysis. There are two easy ways to get the exercise working:

### 1) Opening the exercise with Binder

With Binder it is easy to make Jupyter Notebook files interactive in the browser without any installing.
Go to <https://mybinder.org/> and paste the URL of this repository (https://github.com/cms-opendata-education/zboson-exercise)
into the field "GitHub repository name or URL". After that click the "launch" button and wait a moment.

When Binder has finished building the interactive environment, it will automatically show the contents of the repository. The
exercise can be started by clicking the "Exercise.ipynb" file in the Binder environment.

Note that the Binder environment is just temporary and will be deleted after you choose to close the exercise.

### 2) Downloading the material to be opened with Jupyter Notebook

Another way to open the exercise is to download the repository to your computer and then use Jupyter Notebook to open the 
exercise. This way requires that you have installed Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/) to your computer.

The contents of the repository can be downloaded by clicking the green _Clone or download_ button on the main page of
the repository. Note that all files of the repository have to be in the same directory in the computer.
